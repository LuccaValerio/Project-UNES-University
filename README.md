This is my first HTML project, it is a simple HTML website for a fictional university, where I apply table concepts, paragraphs, some class attributes and the most used classes in HTML.
To run the website, you need to download all the files and place them in a single folder, by doing this you can open it in Sublime or VS code, as it is a website that has not been created an active url this needs to be done this way to view the website in full operation.
